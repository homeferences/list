The Zoom link will be provided via email to registered attendees.\n\nLightning talks may vary on the way they approach that topic but should last about 5 minutes. Have an idea for a talk? Pitch it to us here: https://forms.gle/cWTBNB3qZULmnASK6.\n\nPlease note, we will be recording the PyLadies International Women's Month Lightning Talks. You can disable your camera to prevent being recorded and opt to participate with a random name (e.g. \"I have no name!\") too!\n\nThank you PyLadies for all you do! We hope to see / cohabit a remote space with you on Saturday March 28th from 11:00 AM EDT (UTC/GMT -4 hours) to 1:00pm EDT (UTC/GMT -4 hours)!\n"
